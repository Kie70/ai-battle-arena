Place short audio files here for battle sound effects:
- applause.mp3  (e.g. audience clapping, played when your side scores well or after each response)
- confusion.mp3 (e.g. crowd murmur, played when the other side scores)

You can use free sound from freesound.org or similar. The app will try to play these after each AI response.
